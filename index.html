<p>The Golden Age of Hollywood was a period of great growth, experimentation and
change in the industry that brought international prestige to Hollywood and its movie stars.
During the time industry was under control of the all powerful studio system of the era,
five movie studios known as the “Big Five” dominated: Warner Brothers, RKO, Fox, MGM and Paramount and
smaller studios included Columbia, Universal and United Artists.</p>

<p>The Golden Age of Hollywood began with the silent movie era. Dramatic films
such as D.W. Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation (1915) and comedies such as The Kid (1921)
starring Charlie Chaplin were popular nationwide.</p>

<p>With the introduction of movies with sound, Hollywood producers churned out
Westerns, musicals, romantic dramas, horror films and documentaries.
Studio movie stars were even more idolized, and Hollywood increased its reputation
as the land of affluence and fame.</p>

<p>During World War I, after President Woodrow Wilson declared war on Germany,
the “Big Five” jumped on the political-propaganda bandwagon.Often under pressure
and guidance from the Wilson administration, they produced educational shorts.
They also lent out their wide roster of popular actors to promote America’s war efforts.</p>

<p>By the 1930s, at the height of Hollywood’s Golden Age, the movie industry was
one of the largest businesses in the United States. Even in the depths of the
Great Depression, movies were a weekly escape for many people who loved trading
their struggles for a fictional world, if only for a couple of hours. Despite the
tough economic times, it’s estimated up to 80 million Americans went to the movies
each week during the Depression. Some of the greatest films made in all of Hollywood
history were made in the late 1930s.</p>

<p>As World War II dominated news headlines, people needed to laugh more than ever,
and Hollywood was happy to oblige them. Pre-movie cartoon reels left audiences
guffawing and were often used to promote war propaganda in a lighthearted way.
On a serious note, documentary newsreels brought the realities of war to life in
ways audiences had never experienced yet couldn’t resist. Many established movie
stars enlisted in the armed forces, including Clark Gable, Henry Fonda, Jimmy Stewart
and Mickey Rooney. Hollywood actresses such as Rita Hayworth, Betty Grable and Lana Turner
lent their sensual appeal to the war effort by becoming pinups for love-starved GIs.
Most Hollywood movie stars used their fame to help sell millions of war bonds.</p>

<p>In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled movie studios couldn’t own movie theaters that
showed only their films. This was the beginning of the end of the Golden Age of Hollywood.
Movie studios were also bound by the Hays Code, a voluntary set of rules for censorship in movies.
While not a major issue in the 1950s, it tied their hands even as audiences grew more
liberal in the 1960s.</p>

<p>As television popularity exploded in the 1950s, movie attendance suffered and the
golden age of the silver screen began to die.</p>
