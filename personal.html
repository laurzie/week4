  <h2> Top Four Recommendations:</h2>
  <h3> 1. Casablanca</h3>

  <p>Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into his...
In the role that shot him into stardom, Humphrey Bogart plays Rick Blaine the
owner of a nightclub and gambling house. After running into his ex-lover
Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), Rick must decide whether he is going to help the Resistance
and Ilsa's husband Victor (Paul Henreid) or choice to live a happy life with
the woman he loves. Set during World War II, this film is full Nazis, thieves,
and refugees each with their own agenda. With classic quotes and iconic love story,
Casablanca continues to be one of the best romantic dramas of all time.

<h3>2. Sing in the Rain</h3>
<img src = "images/Singingintherain.jpg" alt = "Don Lockwood iconic scene dancing and singin in the rain"/>
<p> Set in 1927, Hollywood Stars Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, and
Jean Hagen portray Hollywood performers who a trying to transition from
silent films to "talkies." Don Lockwood (Kelly) is part of a famous on-screen
romantic pair with Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). Instead of doing another silent film,
the pair is asked to a do a musical but Lina doesn't have the voice for the songs.
Kathy Selden, an aspiring actress, (Reynolds) is brought in and Don quickly falls
in love with her. Production goes well...until Lina finds out. Singin' in the Rain
is a lighthearted take on a difficult transition for Hollywood.This classic film
stars in perhaps one of the greatest musicals ever made.</p>


<h3>3. Sabrina</h3>

as she tires of being a royal while being on a tour in Europe.
While in Rome, she sneaks out to experience what it's like to be free and to be
an average person. She meets Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), a news reporter who
